## Notable Features of Our Entry

* I'm pretty sure we led the Power Phrase finding race for most of the contest.
  The reason for that is that we had a huge Lovecraft guru on our team.
  He spent the whole contest deciphering your clues.
* The line clearing logic of our solution is only average, but it's implemented
  with a weighted heat map that the pieces just "walk" down to lower numbers.
  You can watch it work with commands like `bin/solve -d data/problem_9.json` or
  read the source code in `lib/hexris/ai.rb`.
* We started by building a totally playable version of the game.  We spent some
  time trying the game manually so we could understand what we were trying to
  create.  You could play this version with a command like
  `bin/play data/problem_0.json`.
